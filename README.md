# Frequentist Properties of Bayes Factor

Calculation of the marginal likelihood with data compression. While the value of the marginal likelihood changes under data compression, the value of the Bayes Factor doesn't. This is the main summary of this work.

We investigate the distribution of the marginal likelihood and Bayes Factor with data compression under different scenarios, for example, when one model is nested in another or when we have two completely separate models.

To run the code, please use one of the notebooks provided. It is also possible to create configuration scripts for different experiments. You can also implement your own model, see `src/modelpair1.py` for an example.
