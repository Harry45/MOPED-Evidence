# Frequentist Properties of Bayes Factor

Calculation of the marginal likelihood with data compression, either using MOPED or the score function.

We investigate the distribution of the marginal likelihood and Bayes Factor with data compression under different scenarios, for example, when one model is nested in another or when we have two completely separate models.

To run the code:

```
python main.py --config=config.py:experiment
```

It is also possible to create configuration scripts for different experiments.
